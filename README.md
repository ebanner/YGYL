Web app for pulling a random webm from the latest [*You Groove You Lose* (YGYL)](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ygyl) thread

## About

This app uses the [4chan API](https://github.com/4chan/4chan-API) to identify the latest [*You Groove You Lose* (YGYL)](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ygyl) thread then plays a random webm from it. My use case is to launch and leave it open in a tab. After the current webm finishes another one will be fetched and played.

## Browser Differences

If you want to leave the app open in a tab and autoplay webms ad infinitum then use firefox. Chrome will not autoplay each webm.
